# break-judge v1
Functionalities:
* There will be a "Dancer" section and a "Judge" section in the "lobby". (For break-judge v1, maximum number of dancers will be 2)
* Each individual will join their respective section.
* A button called "Start Battle" will be available to the judges to click once everyone has joined the "lobby".
* A "Settings" button will be available to change the duration of the timer (More options will be added as more functionalities are implemented).
* "Start Battle" is clicked --> The two dancers will be displayed on opposing sides of the website. The judges will be on the bottom with a grey screen beneath their names.
* There will be a timer, in the form of XX:XX, that will start once the judges press "Begin".
* The judges will also be given the option to "Switch", which will reset the timer for the other dancer.
* A "Judge" button will always be available. This button does 2 things:
* 1) Set the timer to 10 seconds. This is the time limit that the judges have to cast their vote.
* 2) The judges will be given 2 colors; red & blue. They can choose one of these colors to vote for the respective dancer. Their votes will remain anonymous until the 10 seconds are up.
* At the end of the 10 seconds, the vote will be shown and tallied and a point will be given to the appropriate dancer for that round.
* An "End Battle" button will always be available. When this button is pressed, all users will be directed to a new page with the winner being displayed.

Future Implementation:
* Dancers will have elo attached to their name. All dancers will start with the default base elo. Elo will be calculated at the end of each official judging.
* Make amount of dancers flexible.
* Add more options to "Settings" such as judging timer, color of votes, etc.

What?
* A simple web app that allows judges to connect to the platform and display their verdict.
* Its primary use is to judge local breaking battles in Edmonton.

Why?
* This is the first step of a multi-step plan to increase incentives thus attracting more local break dancers.

When?
* This app should be used for any "official jams" that follow standard judging protocol.

Where?
* Edmonton-based for the short-term with hopes of going international in the long run.

* Freestyle Movement creates opportunities for bboys, bgirls, choreographers and freestyle dancers
